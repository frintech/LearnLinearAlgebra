        <h2>What is Linear algebra? </h2>
        Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning vector spaces and linear mappings between such spaces. It includes the study of lines, planes, and subspaces, but is also concerned with properties common to all vector spaces.

        <h2>  Why is Linear Algebra Required? </h2> 
        <p>
            In the abstract, it allows you to manipulate and understand whole systems of equations with huge numbers of dimensions/variables on paper without any fuss, and solve them computationally. Here are some of the real-world relationships that are governed by linear equations and some of its applications:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    	Compatability in structures </li>
                    	<li>Load and displacements in structures</li>
	<li>Compatability in structures</li>
	<li>Finite element analysis (has Mechanical, Electrical, and Thermodynamic applications)</li>
	<li>Stress and strain in more than 1-D</li>
	<li>Mechanical vibrations</li>
	<li>Current and voltage in LCR circuits</li>
	<li>Small signals in nonlinear circuits = amplifiers</li>
	<li>Flow in a network of pipes</li>
	<li>Control theory (governs how state space systems evolve over time, discrete and continuous)</li>
	<li>Control theory (Optimal controller can be found using simple linear algebra)</li>
	<li>Control theory (Model Predictive control is heavily reliant on linear algebra)</li>
	<li>Computer vision (Used to calibrate camera, stitch together stereo images)</li>
	<li>Machine learning (Support Vector Machine)</li>
	<li>Machine learning (Principal component analysis)</li>
	<li>Lots of optimization techniques rely on linear algebra as soon as the dimensionality starts to increase.</li>
	<li>Fit an arbitrary polynomial to some data.</li>
               
            </ul>
